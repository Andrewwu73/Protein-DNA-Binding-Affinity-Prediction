# Protein-DNA Binding Affinity Prediction
 6.802 Project: Predicting Binding Affintiy of Protein-DNA complexes using VAEs for dimensionality reduction.

Reference Final Report.pdf for a complete description of the project.

To train each DNA VAE and Protein VAE, run the individual train scripts in their associated folders. To train the binding network, just run Regression Network.py
